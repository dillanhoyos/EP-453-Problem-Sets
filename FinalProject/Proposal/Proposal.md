# Proposal

### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Jumper

### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "An iOS-based FM Synthesizer that the Users can play over the network.")

Jumper is a Platformer game based on the app Store game "DoodleJump", its mechanics consist on a jumping sprite that keeps going higher by launching thru different platforms. 

### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The Software consists on Mainly SpriteKit and AudioKit. It will be executed in the form of an app

### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

I think the biggest problem im thinking of is to have the main camera to update it self depending on the location of the sprite on the platformer. Also implementing a score system and a UI for the game will take the longest for this Project 

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Jumping implemented with sound. Sprite and background images working. background Music and SFX. Death upon miss of a platform. 



#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can create a platformer game that has sounds implemented, with gameover settings.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

What would be ideal for this project is to create a very similar game to doodleJump, and that does not have bugs.
### In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I need to do more research on spriteKit, and the physics engine of this framework. Also I would like to figure out how to make a UI system for the game, so that its browsable. 
Figure out a way to create Audio Observed objects depending on the proximity of the Sprite with different elements on the Game.
