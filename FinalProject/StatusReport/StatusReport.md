Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to resubmit your proposal and email your instructor!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a scene that creates rectangles and a bouncy sprite. The camera follows the Sprite, there are walls on each side. 
you can control the sprites position by touching the sprite and moving it but is not that effective

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not created a mechanism that creates another set of Rectangles for when the sprite bounces higher, Death barrier, Menu, UI, Score. 
I have not implemented the Sound.
I have not implemented the Dynamic bitMasking so that the platforms are not rigid when the sprite first jumps and the when it lands it needs to e rigid. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have encountered that the bouncing of the sprite needs to be fixed, also the walls of the game I dont know if I want them to just bounce, maybe I want to create that teleporting effect so when it reaches the left barrier it just comes back on the right barrier and so on instead of bouncing every wall.
