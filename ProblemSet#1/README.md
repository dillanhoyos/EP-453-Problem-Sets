### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use GitHub, Markdown, and Setup an IOS environment.

### Description
The Problem Set 1.1 covered how to use the Git version control system with GitHub. I had to learn the basic terminology, such as commit, pull, and push, used in Git/GitHub to understand how to version control software. The Problem Set 1.2 was about writing a read me. In it, we were required to use syntax such as `#`, `*`, and `--` to format the README.md file so that the file is formatted nicely on GitHub when it is displayed. Finally, the Problem Set 1.3 was about Setting up an IOS environment in where you can edit words fonts and styles for the "helloSwift" problem set.
