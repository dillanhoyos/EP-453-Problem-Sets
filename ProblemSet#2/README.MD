- Problem2.2.playground

### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use Variables, Operators and The IOS AudioKIt

### Description

#### Problem 2.1: Variables
Create a file named Problem2.1.playground in Xcode.
Write a Swift code that declares Int, Float, and String variables in the playground. Initialize them to 2021, 0.23, and "Hello Swift!". Print these variable values in reverse order using print(). The printed output should look like this:
Hello Swift! 0.23 2021


#### Problem 2.2: Operators
Create a file named Problem2.2.playground in Xcode.
Create 2 variables called instrumentName and instrumentClass, and assign them string values Guitar and String.
Use a compound assignment operator to add Classical to instrumentName.
Create a variable called frequency and assign 440.
Convert frequency to MIDI and assign it to a variable called midi.
Create a boolean variable called isPlaying and assign it true
Print out the following using the instrumentName and instrumentClass, midi, isPlaying variables:
    Classical Guitar is a String Instrument and is currently playing MIDI note 69: true
Make sure to use the placeholder syntax to print out the values of the variables.

#### Problem 2.3: Oscillator
Copy the example Oscillator Xcode project from the class materials repository.
Change the waveform to a Sawtooth wave.
Add a slider below the frequency slider that controls the oscillator's amplitude in the range between 0 and 1.
Initialize the amplitude slider to 0.2.
Make sure to add Texts to identify the new slider's parameter and its current value (Amplitude and range between 0 ~ 1).
Read the documentation for Oscillator to understand more about its functionality: https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/wiki/Oscillator.

### Dependencies (If applicable)
This program does require the AudioKit library and Xcode
