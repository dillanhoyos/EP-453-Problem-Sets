### Files Included
- README.md 
- Synthesizer Folder
- Problem3.1.playground


### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use Sliders and link them to parameters from AudioKit

### Description

#### Problem 3.1: Array

Create a file named Problem3.1.playground in Xcode.
Create an integer array named numbers.
From the beginning index, this array should hold integer values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Initialize the array in such a way and then print these values after initialization.
The printed output should look like this:
0
1
2
3
4
5
#### Problem 3.2: Simple Synthesizer
Copy the example "Synthesizer" Xcode project.
Add two horizontal sliders to the UI using the swiftui-sliders framework.
One slider should control the overall amplitude of the synthesizer between 0.1 ~ 1.0.
By default, the amplitude is hard-coded value of 0.2.
You need to make this value modulatable using a slider.
Another slider should control the ramp duration of the amplitude between 0.1 ~ 1.0.




### Dependencies (If applicable)
This program does require the AudioKit library and Xcode
	

### Comments
I was not able to complete exercise 3.2 because I was not able to link or create a slider, I tried importing the slider module but it was not inside the Folder of the Synthesizer so it said module missing. then I tried to implement the Slider with Swift Ui documentationn but Could not Make it Work. 

### Acknowledgement
I used the Class examples to create this problemSet.
