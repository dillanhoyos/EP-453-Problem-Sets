### Files Included
- README.md 
- Navigation folder
- Problem5.1.playground


### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to create a navigation view for an app

### Description

## Problem 5.1: Function
- Create a file named `ProblemSet5.1.playground` in Xcode.
- Write a program that computes an average value of a given integer array.
- Create a function named `average` that takes an integer array and returns the average value in the floating point format.
- Test the function by calling it and printing out the average value.

## Problem 5.2: Navigation
- Start by copying the `Navigation` Xcode Project from the class material repository.
- Add another `NavigationLink` that navigates to a new view called `EffectView` (you must make this `struct`) in `ContentView`.
- This `EffectView` should have the same UI functionality as `XYPadView`.
- In `ProcessorController`, add `Chorus` and add it in the signal chain in between LPF and Reverb.
- The x-axis of the `EffectView` should control the `frequency` while the y-axis controls the `depth` of the `Chorus`.
- Be sure to adjust the slider values appropriately for the parameters that they are controlling.



### Dependencies (If applicable)
This program does require the AudioKit library and Xcode
	

### Comments
I did not adjust the parameters for the chorus because i could not do trials on an apple device 

### Acknowledgement
I used the Class examples to create this problemSet and stackOverflow
