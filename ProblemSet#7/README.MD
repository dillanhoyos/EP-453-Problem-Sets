### Files Included
- README.md 
- MotionSynth



### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to create a the motion synth using struct and class

### Description

## Problem 7.1: Expand Motion Synth
- Start from the `MotionSynth` Xcode Project.
- Add another `View` that changes its state (placement, size, colors, etc) based on taking other sensor data besides the attitudes.
- Use `NavigationView` to navigate between the views.
- Add `Flanger` to the synthesizer before the `MoogLadder`.
- Control the `feedback` and `frequency` parameters using other sensors and parameters from `CoreMotion`.
- Add a functionality to toggle the synthesizer on/off based on when the user single taps the screen.
- You can use [`TapGesture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/tapgesture)
 for this. It work very similarly to `DragGesture`.
- Try to build a different instrument from the example one that responds to the user in a way that feels like intuitive gestural control.




### Dependencies (If applicable)
This program does require the AudioKit library and Xcode
