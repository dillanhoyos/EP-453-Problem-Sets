### Files Included
- README.md 
- MultiTouch



### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to create a dictionary, and utilize the multitouch functions

### Description


## Problem 8.1: Expand MultiTouch Synth
- Start from the `MultiTouchSynth` Xcode Project.
- Convert the project into the navigation based system.
- Create a new swift file named `XYPad`.
- Recreate the `XYPad` from week 5 to be multitouched, meaning it must have up to 10 circle dots moving with your fingers.
- Create another synth class named `MultiTouchSynth2` that responds to the multitouch events through the new `XYPad`.
- This synth class must have at least three `Node`'s connected (e.g. `Oscillator`, `LowpassFilter`, and `Reverb`).
- Use the x- and y-axis of multitouch inputs to control this synthesizer.
- Try to build a different instrument from the class material that responds to the user in a way that feels like intuitive gestural control.



### Dependencies (If applicable)
This program does require the AudioKit library and Xcode
	

### Comments
I could not implement the multitouch on the synth

### Acknowledgement
I used the Class examples to create this problemSet and stackOverflow
